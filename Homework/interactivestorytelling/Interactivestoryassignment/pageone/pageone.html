<h3>Sir Gawain of New Rapport</h3>

<p>It has been centuries since the last great war that raged across the planet 

devastating whole continents in its wake. No one really remembers how or why it started, 

as that knowledge died with the last passing of the people of that age. Those that survived 

the war rebuilt what was left of their homes and new countries emerged from the rubble 

of the old world. In one such country, which was called the United States many centuries 

ago, there was the large municipality of New Rapport. In this city lived a man named 

Dominic Quintin, who made his living as the city historian which was considered by 

most people in the city to be so mundane that no one else in the city wanted it. It was his 

duty to chronicle the history of their city and maintain the records for the people of 

Rapport, these records are stored in the city library. Though he would admit that most of 

the time his job was rather tedious, but it also comes with certain perks such as access to 

the city's vast library of books that survived the war. Most of his spare time, he could be 

found at the library sitting in his office reading various types of books. Sometimes it 

would be a great mystery like Sherlock Holmes  by Arthur Conan Doyle or a great drama 

like A Lesson Before Dying by Ernest J Gaines. Very few understood his passion for 

books and some would even say that reading was his whole world to him. However, none 

of the literature held more of a hold on his heart than the books revolving around chivalry, 

like The Book of Arthur by John Matthews. Many of the people in the city shunned any 

type of literature that did not have a practical application in their way of life. To these 

people,  the values described in the very writing of these were as archaic as the books </p>
