<h3>Sir Gawain of New Rapport</h3>

<p>ritual. They were almost to the northern gate when they saw a man dressed in full armor 

atop of a horse blocking their way. The man's helmet hid his features from sight, as he 

stated that his name was Sir Gawain of New Rapport and ordered them to release their 

prisoner. Among the guards were the Mayor's son, the Mayor's nephew, and the rest of 

the Mayor's son's friends, who took great pleasure in mocking the armored man and 

ordered him to move out of the way. Sir Gawain however instead of moving, lifted his 

makeshift lance up, and charged at the guards. At his first charge, many of the guards 

threw themselves out of his way, while the Mayor's Nephew was not so lucky and was 

knocked headfirst into one of the sewer drains that were along side of the road where his 

head became stuck! Before he could wheel his horse around for a second charge, the 

guards were upon him trying to pull him from his horse. However one of the guards, in 

their frantic rush to get a hold of Sir Gawain got caught on a part of the horse's saddle. 

This caused the saddle to pinch the horse painfully, which caused it to buck wildly, 

sending many of the guards flying up into the air and writhing in pain upon the ground. 

Sitting along the side of the road on a bench, Captain Campbell could not help but to 

laugh at the wild spectacle before him, almost laughing so hard that he almost rolled right 

off of the bench! Sir Gawain's horse's head thrashed wildly from side to side, as it reared

up into the air with its front legs kicking out wildly at the guards. One of the horse's head 

thrashes caught one of the guards by surprise and threw him up into the air where he 

crashed through one of the windows of a nearby building. Another guard tried to take Sir 

Gawain's lance, but when the horse reared up again it lifted the guard up into the air! 

However when the guard fell back down to the ground, he was still holding onto the 

lance, which came down full force onto his head basically knocking himself unconscious!
