<h3>Sir Gawain of New Rapport</h3>

<p>Sir Gawain tried in vain to get his horse back under control but in the mist of doing so his 

horse spins around but when it does, his lance slams right into the stomach of yet another 

guard! A loud clanging sound could be heard, as one of the guards threw a large stone at 

Sir Gawain and hit his helm so hard that he knocked it off of his head! Sir Gawain was 

knocked unconscious and was spread out across the back of his horse, as it being spooked 

by the sound of the helm being hit ran off at a full sprint up the road and disappeared into 

the maze of buildings leaving nothing behind but a dented helm which slid to a stop right 

in front of the Captain! He spots the Mayor's son, who had been hiding behind one of the 

rain barrels along side of the road, getting ready to run for help but he simply walked up 

behind him and brought the helm down upon the unsuspecting young man's head! The 

young man fell down to the ground with a thud, as the Captain looked the helm over 

curiously and saw something on the inside of the helm in bold print that caught his eye 

"Property of New Rapport Library".  The sound of heavy footsteps caught his attention, 

as he quickly hid the helm behind some nearby boxes. The Mayor was leading the people 

down the road toward the starting point of the trial by ordeal but was awestruck to find all 

the guards that were escorting the Captain spread out all over the road some writhing in 

pain others laying there unconscious. The Mayor stopped short when he saw his son 

laying unconscious on the ground beside one of the rain barrels along the side of the road. 

He rushed to his son, cradling his head close against his chest, as his angry eyes turned to 

the Captain. The Mayor yelled at the Captain demanding how could he have done such a 

thing not only to his son but to the other guards that were escorting him. Captain 

Campbell looked at him smugly, as he held up his hands to show that they were still 

bound by chains and asked him how could he do all of this with his hands and feet bound
