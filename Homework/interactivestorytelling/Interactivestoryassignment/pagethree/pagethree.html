<h3>Sir Gawain of New Rapport</h3>

<p>necessary reserves the city needs. Many of the members of the city council wanted to 

banish the guards from the city for neglecting their duties, however the Mayor placed the 

blame squarely on the shoulders upon the Captain of the guard, whose name was Eric 

Campbell. The Captain was a well respected member of the city and well liked by almost 

all of the people of the city except for one family. That being the Mayor and his family, 

who detested him because he was jealous of his popularity among their people. Many of 

the people believed that he disliked him because the Mayor felt he was a threat to his 

position in the city. Many among the council believed that this was one of the reasons 

that the Mayor was placing the blame on the Captain and not the guards, the other reason 

was that the guards that were on duty were his nephew and his son. 

After hours of deliberation, the Mayor and his supporters on the council sentenced 

the Captain to under go a ritual that had not been used in years. The ritual was a trail by 

ordeal, which was considered far too cruel on the guilty by the citizens of the city, which 

he would be forced to undergo at first light the next morning. In this ritual, the guilty 

would be strapped into a specially designed harness. The harness was specially made to 

fit onto the shoulders of a person, where their hands would be strapped directly to it, 

while large metal buckets were connected to it by chains which were linked to large iron 

rings at each end of the harness. The way this trail by ordeal worked is that the guilty 

would be marched through the streets of the city, while citizens would either drop stones 

into the buckets or throw the stones at them. The march would start at the northern gate 

of the city and would end when the guilty would marched all around the city until they 

were brought back to the northern gate once again.
